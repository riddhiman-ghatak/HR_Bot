## Model overview

The HR Chatbot leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), specifically the `deepset/bert-base-cased-squad2` model. BERT is a state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) model developed by Google that excels in understanding context and nuance in textual data.The BERT model has been fine-tuned on a custom dataset containing HR-related queries and responses. The fine-tuning process is detailed in the `base_line_BERT_uncased.ipynb` notebook. Fine-tuning helps the model specialize in understanding and responding to queries specific to human resources, improving its performance on this particular domain.
